# apis

Recently, many exciting releases of key technologies used in microservice architectures have been released.  
Unfortunately, I couldn't find any examples online that use the latest releases of those technologies, so
I have created this sample, which works out the kinks I encountered.

* Bazel (v7-bzlmod)
* Rust (1.76)
* Protobuf (v21.7)
* gRPC (v1.48.1)
* GoogleApis
